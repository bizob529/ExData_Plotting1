#Exploratory Data Analysis: Course Project #1

Below are instructions for using the files in this repository to create the 4 plots shown in Course Project #1 for the Johns Hopkins University/Coursera course "Exploratory Data Analysis" which can be found here:

>https://class.coursera.org/exdata-011/


##Instructions
*Download the four R scripts into your working directory: `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, and `plot4.R`. 
*Source each script into your R workspace using the syntax `source("plot1.R")`. Repeat for all 4 scripts.
*After you source each file, you will be instructed to call a function with the syntax `getPlot3()`. 
*Call all 4 functions to create all 4 plots.


##Additional Notes

A folder called `ExpData_A1_Plots` will be created in your working directory. The data will be downloaded and unzipped into this folder. The PNG files for the 4 plots will also be created in this folder.

Each script will attempt to create this directory and download and unzip the data file `household_power_consumption.txt`. If this directory exists with this data file inside of it, the script will not recreate the directory or redownload and unzip the data file.

Note that the data file will be read into R by each script. After this step, each script will create the appropriate graph(s) and write it into a PNG file.
